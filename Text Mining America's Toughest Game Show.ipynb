This iconic TV show could be described as quizbowl with gambling. In each 30-minute episode, three contestants compete in answering questions with specific monetary value, accumulating and wagering their earnings throughout each round. It's no petty cash, either; a recent <em>Jeopardy!</em> champion, James Holzhauer, walked away with $2.46 million after winning in 33 consecutive episodes. </p>\n","<p>However, for an aspiring <em>Jeopardy!</em> champion, the amount of knowledge required to excel at the game might seem discouraging at first glance. How can it be possible to know everything about everything? Some <em>Jeopardy!</em> enthusiasts have turned to data analysis for the answers&mdash;and we'll do just that. In this project, we'll use basic text mining techniques on <em>Jeopardy!</em> data to spot trends in the types of questions asked.

A glimpse ahead\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_796/img/Jeopardy_game_board.png\" alt></p>\n","<p>Here are the basic rules of the game. Three contestants compete against each other in three rounds: <em><strong>Jeopardy</strong></em>, <em><strong>Double Jeopardy</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Final Jeopardy</strong></em>. In <em>Jeopardy</em> and <em>Double Jeopardy</em> , each round has six categories, with five answers per category. After an answer is read by the show's host, Alex Trebeck, each contestant competes to be the first to come up with the correct question to the answer. </p>\n","<p>Each answer has a monetary value based on its difficulty. The monetary values in the <em>Double Jeopardy</em> round are double the values of the answers in <em>Jeopardy</em> round. In <em>Final Jeopardy</em>, the contestants bet any amount from their accumulated earnings on one difficult answer. </p>\n","<p>For a complete breakdown of the rules, check out the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!#Gameplay\"><em>Jeopardy!</em> Wikipedia page</a>.

Cleaning the categories\n","<p><em>Jeopardy!</em> categories are notorious for being witty and unique. An example of a category title is \"Element, Spel-ement\" (from the episode aired on March 28, 2011). Every question in this category gave the contestant a list of chemical element names, and the contestant had to spell the word created by the symbols of those elements (example: boron, aluminum, potassium = \"balk\"). </p>\n","<p>Some categories have more straightforward titles, such as the \"Indonesia\" category (from the episode on March 25, 2011), which had questions all about Indonesia.</p>\n","<p>You can imagine that text mining from these wordy and specific categories might be difficult&mdash;and this would probably be correct.

A few insights\n","<p>John, William, James, and Henry… who might these people be?
