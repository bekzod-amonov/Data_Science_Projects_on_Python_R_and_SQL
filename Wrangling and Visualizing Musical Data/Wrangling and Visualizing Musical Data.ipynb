Conclusion\n<p>We set out asking if the degree to which a chord is \"idiomatic\" on an instrument affects how frequently it is used by a songwriter. It seems that is indeed the case. In a large representative sample of pop/rock songs from the historical Billboard charts, the chords most often learned first by guitarists and pianists are the most common. In fact, chords commonly deemed <em>easy</em> or <em>beginner-friendly</em> on <strong>both</strong> piano and guitar are far and away the most common in the corpus.</p>\n<p>We also examined a subset of 35 songs from seven piano- and guitar-heavy artists and found that guitarists and pianists tend to use different sets of chords for their songs. This was an extremely small (and likely not representative) sample, so we can do nothing more than hypothesize that this trend might carry over throughout the larger dataset. But it seems from this exploration that it's worth a closer look.</p>\n<p>There are still more questions to explore with this dataset. What about band-driven genres like classic R&amp;B and funk, where artists like James Brown and Chicago build chords from a large number of instruments each playing a single note? What about \"progressive\" bands like Yes and Genesis, where \"easy\" and \"idiomatic\" may be less of a concern during the songwriting process? And what if we compared this dataset to a collection of chords from classical songs, jazz charts, folk songs, liturgical songs?</p>\n<p>There's only one way to find out!</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"68"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set to TRUE or FALSE to reflect your answer\nhypothesis_valid <- ....\n\n# Set to TRUE or FALSE to reflect your answer\nmore_data_needed <- ....","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"ir","display_name":"R","language":"R"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"3.5.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
